# Stock Application
An application created to predict a stock's price after an amount of days. This is done by reading the stock's information through an Excel spreadsheet file at a specific order and using simple data functions to create new data points of the stock's predicted price for each new day.

his project was done during highschool as a project within a two week timeframe. The major flaw of this project are the inaccurate data functions analyzing the stock's trends and as well insufficient factors considered when calculating the stock's price (neglecting news of the company, company sales, social trend, etc.).
