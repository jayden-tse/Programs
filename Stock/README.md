An application created to predict a stock's price after an amount of days. This is done by reading the stock's information through an Excel spreadsheet file at a specific order and using simple data functions to create new data points of the stock's predicted price for each new day.

This project was done during highschool within a two week timeframe. The major flaws of this project are the inaccurate data functions analyzing the stock's trends and as well the insufficient factors considered that may affect the stock's price (news of the company, company sales, social trend, etc.).
